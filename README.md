# MLINA 

The contents of this project are based on the code developed during the reading of 
"[Machine Learning in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-in-action)" by Peter Harrington, from Manning books.

The example code in the book is written in Python. While I am learning the concepts and working along with the Python examples, I am also converting them to 
Groovy so that I have something I might actually use and understand at a later date.
